# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed project from "tau" to "fir": module path, binary, config directory (.tau → .fir), all references.

### Fixed

- `/resume` session selector: `SortRelevance` mode now uses the rich search engine (`FilterAndSortSessions` with fuzzy/phrase/regex token support) instead of silently falling through to threaded; all sort modes (`threaded`, `recent`, `relevance`) now call `FilterAndSortSessions` for consistent search behaviour.
- `/resume` session selector: strip ASCII control characters (newlines, carriage returns, etc.) and Unicode line/paragraph separators (U+2028, U+2029) from session names AND working-directory paths before rendering; a session whose name or `cwd` contained an embedded newline caused each such session in the visible window to write an extra terminal row, shifting all subsequent rows down — the "items 73-83 (or 83+) shift down one line" visual glitch. Also sanitize DEL (0x7F) and C1 control codes (U+0080–U+009F).
- `/resume` session selector: increased visible window from 12 to 20 sessions (scroll pane is taller, easier to navigate large session lists).
- `/changelog` command now displays newest version last (at the bottom of the terminal) so it's most visible in both TUI and ACP modes.

### Added

- Include agent version in `/session` slash command output (ACP and TUI modes).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-19
